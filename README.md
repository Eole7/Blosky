# Blosky

## Installation
- Install the JDK (Java Development Kit) to be able to compile your plugins: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html
- Download the latest version of Blosky in portable or installer version: https://github.com/Eole7/Blosky/releases. For the moment, Blosky has only been packaged for Windows
  - If you select the version to be installed, ignore the Windows SmartScreen alerts, and then follow the instructions given by the installer
  - If you choose the portable version, just extract the zip file
- Blosky has only a few syntaxes for the moment and lacks basic features; don't plan to make a real plugin with it
